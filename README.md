# pkm-sandwich-recipe

This project helps you find sandwich recipes based on the effects you want. You can input your desired effects via the web interface and the website will filter through the manually added sandwich recipes to find the ones that match your criteria.

The project was inspired by the [Pokemon Sandwich Simulator](https://github.com/cecilbowen/pokemon-sandwich-simulator), which allows users to create virtual sandwiches with different effects. However, it can be difficult to crack the algorithm to find sandwiches automatically. That's where this project comes in - it provides a simpler way to search for sandwiches with specific effects.

It's important to note that the sandwich recipes in this project were manually added, so the selection is not exhaustive. However, the website provides a great starting point for finding sandwiches that meet your needs.

Additionally, this project was created as a learning project using TypeScript, so it may not be perfect yet. However, the website is fully functional and provides a useful tool for anyone looking to find a sandwich recipe with specific effects.
