# pkm-sandwitch-recipe

This project is inspired by sandwich recipe simulator (https://github.com/cecilbowen/pokemon-sandwich-simulator)
As we have a simulator, why don't we try to search it? I am an end-user, and I just want to know which sandwich I need.
However, I found that it is VERY DIFFICULTTTTTTT to crack the algorithm to find sandwich automatically. 
So, this project just filter the recipes I know. 


In addition, I just learned how to make a website using typescript. So, this is not perfect yet...
